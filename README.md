# Appstream to Nulecule

[Appstream](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/) is a project which helps developers to make their apps friendly for software centers and also provides tooling for creation of such software center.

[Nulecule](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/) ia a project which helps developers to package, distribute and deploy their multi-container application.

This repository aims to bring these projects together - learn Nulecule how to describe applications in Appstream (AppData) format and provide tools which makes the conversion from AppData to Nulecule and back simple.
